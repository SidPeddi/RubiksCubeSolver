# Rubik's-Cube-Solver

## Running the program to solve your rubik's cube.

You must first press the import button and include all the colors of the cube as shown below.
     your cube: 

           OYG
           WYO
           YWG
       YBB RRR WWW OOB
       GBR BRB YGR YOR
       RBW BGO BOY OGG
           RWW
           OWG
           YYG
     
      Your solution :) 
      R2 U' R B2 U' R2 U' B R2 U' L U R2 U' D L D B D B' D' L2 F2 L F2 R' D2 R 


On top is your scrambled cube and make sure you are holding it in that orientation before you try applying the solution

The top of the flat cube is the first 3 rows of the cube. That is the **TOP**.  
    
     OYG
     WYO
     YWG 
 
The left side of the cube is most left 3 rows in the middle chunk. That is the **LEFT**

     YBB
     GBR
     RBW 

The front side is: 

     RRR
     BRB
     BGO 
     
And so on. 

Here is an image showing the correct orientation.

It matches the cube printed in the console

         OYG
         WYO
         YWG
     YBB RRR WWW OOB
     GBR BRB YGR YOR
     RBW BGO BOY OGG
         RWW
         OWG
         YYG

New to cube Notation? Don't understand what this `R2 U' R B2 U' R2 U'` means?
[This website](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/) explains it very well.
